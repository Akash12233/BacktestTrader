# BacktestTrader

A modular algorithmic trading system for backtesting and paper trading, designed to analyze S&P 500 tickers with a blend of fundamental and technical strategies.

## Overview
"BacktestTrader" is a Python-based project that simulates trading strategies on historical data, ranks assets by return on investment (ROI), and supports paper trading. It leverages multiprocessing for efficiency and includes a Streamlit UI for interactivity. Inspired by the WUSIF hackathon, this system mirrors workflows used by quantitative trading firms for research and alpha discovery.

## Features
- **Multi-Asset Backtesting**: Backtests 10â€“50 tickers simultaneously using multiprocessing.
- **Fundamental + Technical Analysis**: Filters for positive EBITDA growth and uses a golden cross strategy (50-day vs. 200-day MA).
- **Performance Ranking**: Ranks tickers by ROI for top performers.
- **Paper Trading Simulation**: Mimics live trading in a risk-free environment.
- **Visualization**: Generates equity curve plots with Matplotlib.
- **Modular Design**: Built with OOP and LLD principles for extensibility.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BacktestTrader.git
   cd BacktestTrader
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure API Key**:
   - Obtain a free API key from [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/).
   - Update `config.yaml` with your API key and preferred tickers.
4. **Create Output Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir output
   ```

## Usage
- **Backtest Mode**:
  ```bash
  python main.py --mode backtest
  ```
  - Analyzes historical data and ranks tickers by ROI.
- **Paper Trading Mode**:
  ```bash
  python main.py --mode paper
  ```
  - Simulates live trading and saves an equity curve.
- **Streamlit UI**:
  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_ui/app.py
  ```
  - Launches an interactive interface to run backtests or paper trading.
